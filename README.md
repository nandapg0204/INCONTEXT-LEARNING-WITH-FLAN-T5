 Includes zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inference modes for different summarization tasks.
  ### <span style="color:#00ADEF;">Dataset Integration:</span>
 Utilizes the "knkarthick/dialogsum" dataset for training and testing dialogue summarization capabilities
## <span style="color:#00ADEF;">Dataset Description</span>
  The "knkarthick/dialogsum" dataset consists of 14460 instances of dialogues paired with human-generated summaries. Each dialogue instance is structured as a conversation typically found in diverse contexts such as customer service interactions, meetings, and informal discussions. This dataset is formatted in a way that supports training and evaluating dialogue summarization models, aiming to improve automated text summarization capabilities through machine learning approaches. With its ample sample size and variety of conversational scenarios, it serves as a robust resource for advancing natural language processing tasks related to dialogue understanding and summarization.
## <span style="color:#00ADEF;">LLM Model</span>
  The "google/flan-t5-base" model is a variant of the T5 architecture optimized for fine-tuning on applied natural language processing tasks. It excels in sequence-to-sequence operations such as dialogue summarization, leveraging its pre-trained knowledge and scalable design. This base-sized model strikes a balance between computational efficiency and performance, making it suitable for tasks that require generating concise summaries from dialogues. It benefits from Google's extensive research in language modeling and is designed to handle diverse NLP tasks effectively, offering robust performance in generating accurate and contextually appropriate summaries for various dialogue contexts.
## <span style="color:#00ADEF;">In-context Learning Inference Phases</span>
  In this project, we leverage the Google FLAN-T5 base model for dialogue summarization tasks using various inference techniques. Here's how the model performs across different inference modes:
  ### <span style="color:#00ADEF;">Zero-Shot Inference:</span>
 Zero-shot inference allows the model to summarize dialogues without any specific prompt tailored to the task. This demonstrates the model's ability to generate summaries based solely on the context provided by the dialogue itself.
  ### <span style="color:#00ADEF;">Zero-Shot Inference with Specific instruction:</span>
 In this mode, the model is given a standardized prompt structure to summarize dialogues. It involves providing a general instruction on summarizing the conversation, which guides the model to generate concise summaries.
  ### <span style="color:#00ADEF;">One-Shot Inference:</span>
 One-shot inference involves feeding the model with a single example dialogue and its corresponding human-written summary. This mode tests the model's ability to generalize from a single instance and generate coherent summaries for similar dialogues.
  ### <span style="color:#00ADEF;">Few-Shot Inference:</span>
 Few-shot inference expands on one-shot inference by providing the model with multiple examples of dialogues and their summaries. This mode assesses the model's capacity to learn from a small amount of data and generalize to new dialogues effectively.
## <span style="color:#00ADEF;">Observations</span>
  The most notable observation is the marked improvement in summarization quality with few-shot inference compared to zero-shot and one-shot approaches. The ability to leverage multiple examples enhances the model's understanding and synthesis of dialogue contexts, leading to more accurate and informative summaries.
## <span style="color:#00ADEF;">Conclusion</span>
  In-context learning, such as with FLAN-T5, faces drawbacks including increased computational demands due to expanded context windows, necessitating additional text processing. Larger models may perform better in capturing nuanced contextual dependencies but require substantial computational resources and memory. Conversely, smaller models may struggle with complex context understanding but offer efficiency advantages. Balancing model size with performance is crucial for optimizing in-context learning outcomes, ensuring effective utilization of resources while maintaining computational feasibility.
